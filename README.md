## Katalon

[Katalon](https://www.katalon.com/) is used for integration testing Web UI and Web API components in Boundless Server. For more details, refer to [katalon/README.md](./katalon/README.md).

## Test Data

The [test_data](./test_data) directory contains test data that is used by various integration tests. It should be copied into the GeoServer data directory before you run any tests.
